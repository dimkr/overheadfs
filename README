Overview
========

overheadfs is a FUSE (https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) file system which
delegates all file system operations to the file system mounted below it. In
other words, it's a proxy file system.

The only effect of mounting overheadfs on a certain directory is the overhead of
FUSE.

overheadfs is mostly useful for demonstration of FUSE and as reference code for
file systems that mirror the original contents of their mount point, with
exceptions: for example, a file system mounted on /etc, which mirrors all files
except a dynamically-generated resolv.conf that specifies a random DNS server.

Building
========

overheadfs is built using Meson (http://mesonbuild.com).

    meson build
    ninja -C build install

overheadfs is compatible with both libfuse3 and the legacy libfuse2.
